hyperglass uses [Netmiko](https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko) to interact with devices via SSH/telnet. [All platforms supported by Netmiko](https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko/blob/develop/PLATFORMS.md) are supported by hyperglass.

## Netmiko Platforms

<Callout type="info">
    Just because Netmiko supports a given platform doesn't mean it will automatically work with
    hyperglass. hyperglass has a limited number of built in directives (listed below). Any platforms
    other than the ones listed below will require you to [add a custom
    directive](configuration/examples/add-your-own-command.mdx) for each command you wish to make
    available.
