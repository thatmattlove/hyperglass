<Steps>

### Install Docker

<Cards>
    <Cards.Card
        title="Docker Engine Installation Guide"
        href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/"
        target="_blank"
        arrow
    />
</Cards>

### Download hyperglass

```shell copy
mkdir /home/hyperglass
cd /home/hyperglass
wget "https://github.com/thatmattlove/hyperglass/blob/main/compose.yaml"
```

### Optional: Quickstart

Do this if you just want to see the hyperglass page working with a fake device.

```shell copy
mkdir data
wget -O ./data/devices.yaml "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thatmattlove/hyperglass/refs/heads/main/.samples/sample_devices.yaml"
docker compose up
```

Navigate to http://IPADDRESS:8001

### Enable auto-restart

You may want to ensure that Hyperglass stays running even after a reboot.
To do this, you can easily change the "restart" parameter in `compose.yaml` to `always`.
