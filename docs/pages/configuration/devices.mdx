<Callout type="tip">

hyperglass ships with predefined [directives](/configuration/directives.mdx) (commands) for the following [platforms](platforms.mdx):

<SupportedPlatforms />

All built in directives require that the following `attrs` be defined on each device using the directive:

| Attribute | Value                                                     |
| :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `source4` | IPv4 address used to source Ping and Traceroute commands. |
| `source6` | IPv6 address used to source Ping and Traceroute commands. |

**Example**

```yaml filename="devices.yaml" {5-7} copy
devices:
    - name: New York, NY
      address: 192.0.2.1
      platform: cisco_ios
      attrs:
          source4: 192.0.2.1
          source6: "2001:db8::1"
```

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
    If you do not utilize IPv6 in your network, you'll need to create your own directive that only
    has IPv4 commands.
</Callout>

## Examples

### Simple

```yaml filename="devices.yaml" copy
devices:
    - name: New York, NY
      address: 192.0.2.1
      platform: cisco_ios
      credential:
          username: you
          password: your password
    - name: San Francisco, CA
      address: 192.0.2.2
      platform: juniper
      credential:
          username: you
          password: your password
```

<h3 className="_font-semibold _tracking-tight _text-slate-900 dark:_text-slate-100 _mt-8 _text-2xl">
    {" "}
    <DocsButton href="/configuration/directives" /> With Directives
</h3>

In this example, an additional directive `cisco-show-lldp-neighbors` is added to the built-in directives.

```yaml filename="devices.yaml" copy {8-9}
devices:
    - name: New York, NY
      address: 192.0.2.1
      platform: cisco_ios
      credential:
          username: you
          password: your password
      directives:
          - cisco-show-lldp-neighbors
```

<h3 className="_font-semibold _tracking-tight _text-slate-900 dark:_text-slate-100 _mt-8 _text-2xl">
    {" "}
    <DocsButton href="/configuration/directives" /> Disable Built-in Directives
</h3>

In this example, _only_ the `cisco-show-lldp-neighbors` directive will be available. Built-in directives are disabled.

```yaml filename="devices.yaml" copy {8-10}
devices:
    - name: New York, NY
      address: 192.0.2.1
      platform: cisco_ios
      credential:
          username: you
          password: your password
      directives:
          - builtin: false
          - cisco-show-lldp-neighbors
```

<h3 className="_font-semibold _tracking-tight _text-slate-900 dark:_text-slate-100 _mt-8 _text-2xl">
    {" "}
    <DocsButton href="/configuration/directives" /> Enable Specifc Built-in Directives
</h3>

In this example, only specified built-in directives are made available.

```yaml filename="devices.yaml" copy {8-9}
devices:
    - name: New York, NY
      address: 192.0.2.1
      platform: cisco_ios
      credential:
          username: you
          password: your password
      directives:
          - builtin: [bgp_route, traceroute]
```
