## Structured

Devices that support responding to a query with structured or easily parsable data can have their response data placed into an easier to read table (or JSON, when using the REST API). Currently, the following platforms have structured data supported in hyperglass:

-   Arista EOS
-   FRRouting
-   Huawei VRP
-   Juniper Junos
-   Mikrotik RouterOS/SwitchOS

When structured output is available, hyperglass checks the RPKI state of each BGP prefix returned using one of two methods:

1. **From the router's perspective** - Uses the RPKI validation state as determined by the router itself
2. **From an external RPKI validation service** - Queries an external service to determine RPKI state independently

For external validation, hyperglass supports two backends:
- **Cloudflare**: Uses [Cloudflare's public RPKI service](https://rpki.cloudflare.com/) via GraphQL API
- **Routinator**: Connects to your own [Routinator](https://github.com/NLnetLabs/routinator) RPKI validator instance

Additionally, hyperglass provides the ability to control which BGP communities are shown to the end user.

For devices with structured traceroute support (Arista EOS, FRRouting, Huawei VRP, Juniper Junos, and MikroTik RouterOS), hyperglass can enhance the output with IP enrichment data including ASN information, organization names, country codes, and IXP detection using real-time lookups from BGP.tools.

| :-------------------------------- | :-------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `structured.rpki.mode`            | String          | router        | Use `router` to use the router's view of the RPKI state, or `external` to use an external validation service.                        |
| `structured.rpki.backend`         | String          | cloudflare    | When using `external` mode, choose `cloudflare` or `routinator` as the validation backend.                                           |
| `structured.rpki.rpki_server_url` | String          |               | When using `routinator` backend, specify the base URL of your Routinator server (e.g., `http://rpki.example.com:3323`).             |
| `structured.communities.mode`     | String          | deny          | Use `deny` to deny any communities listed, `permit` to _only_ permit communities listed, or `name` to append friendly names.         |

### RPKI Examples

#### Show RPKI State from the Device's Perspective

```yaml filename="config.yaml" copy {2}
structured:
    rpki:
        mode: router
```

#### Show RPKI State from Cloudflare's Public Service

```yaml filename="config.yaml" copy {2-4}
structured:
    rpki:
        mode: external
        backend: cloudflare
```

#### Show RPKI State from a Custom Routinator Server

```yaml filename="config.yaml" copy {2-5}
structured:
    rpki:
        mode: external
        backend: routinator
        rpki_server_url: "http://rpki.example.com:8080"
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    **Routinator URL Format**
    
    The `rpki_server_url` should be the base URL of your Routinator HTTP web API endpoint. This is typically different from the RTR port (3323). The URL should not include the `/validity` path as hyperglass will append this automatically.
</Callout>

### Community Filtering Examples

#### Deny Listed Communities by Regex pattern

```yaml filename="config.yaml" {5-6}
structured:
    communities:
        mode: deny
        items:
            - '^65000:1\d+$' # don't show any communities starting with 65000:1. 65000:1234 would be denied, but 65000:4321 would be permitted.
            - "65000:2345" # don't show the 65000:2345 community.
```

#### Permit only Listed Communities

```yaml filename="config.yaml" {5-6}
structured:
    communities:
        mode: permit
        items:
            - "^65000:.*$" # permit any communities starting with 65000, but no others.
            - "1234:1" # permit only the 1234:1 community.
```

#### Append Friendly Names to Communities

```yaml filename="config.yaml" {2-10}
structured:
    communities:
        mode: name
        names:
            "65000:1000": "Upstream Any"
            "65000:1001": "Upstream A (all locations)"
            "65000:1101": "Upstream A Location 1"
            "65000:1201": "Upstream A Location 2"
            "65000:1002": "Upstream B (all locations)"
            "65000:1102": "Upstream B Location 1"
            "65000:2000": "IXP Any"
```

### IP Enrichment Examples

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    **IP Enrichment Requirements**
    
    IP enrichment is currently supported for traceroute outputs on supported platforms.
    
    The system uses real-time lookups from BGP.tools for maximum accuracy and reliability.
</Callout>

#### Enable IP Enrichment for Traceroute

```yaml filename="config.yaml" copy {2-4}
structured:
    # Ensure `structured:` exists to enable structured output. By default the
    # structured table output is enabled when this block is present. To disable
    # the structured traceroute table, set `structured.enable_for_traceroute: false`.
    ip_enrichment:
        enrich_traceroute: true
```

#### Enable IP Enrichment

```yaml filename="config.yaml" copy {2-4}
structured:
    ip_enrichment:
        enrich_traceroute: true
        # cache_timeout is deprecated - real-time lookups are used
```

#### Enable IP Enrichment for Traceroute

```yaml filename="config.yaml" copy {2-3}
structured:
    ip_enrichment:
        enrich_traceroute: true
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    **Performance Considerations**
    
    - Initial cache loading may take 30-60 seconds on first startup
    - Data is cached locally using pickle format for ultra-fast subsequent loads
    - Cache files are stored in `/etc/hyperglass/ip_enrichment/`
    - Minimum cache timeout is 24 hours (86400 seconds) to prevent excessive API usage
</Callout>

### Structured Traceroute Configuration

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    **Structured Traceroute Support**
    
    Structured traceroute with rich metadata is available for:
    - **Arista EOS**: Parses Unix-style traceroute output with hostname, multiple RTT support, and MPLS labels
    - **FRRouting**: Parses Unix-style traceroute output with load balancing and multi-path support
    - **Huawei VRP**: Parses Unix-style traceroute output
    - **Juniper Junos**: Parses traceroute output with MPLS labels, multipath, and partial timeouts
    - **MikroTik RouterOS/SwitchOS**: Parses multi-table format with statistics
    
    When IP enrichment is enabled, traceroute hops are enhanced with ASN numbers, organization names, country codes, prefixes, and IXP detection.
</Callout>

#### Complete Structured Traceroute Setup

```yaml filename="config.yaml" copy {2-12}
structured:
    rpki:
        mode: external
        backend: routinator
        rpki_server_url: "https://rpki.example.com"
    communities:
        mode: name
        names:
            "65000:1000": "Transit Routes"
            "65000:2000": "Peer Routes"
    ip_enrichment:
        enrich_traceroute: true
        # cache_timeout is deprecated - real-time lookups are used
```

#### Structured Traceroute with Cloudflare RPKI

```yaml filename="config.yaml" copy {2-9}
structured:
    rpki:
        mode: external
        backend: cloudflare
    ip_enrichment:
        enrich_traceroute: true
```

#### Minimal Structured Traceroute (No IP Enrichment)

```yaml filename="config.yaml" copy {2-4}
structured:
    ip_enrichment:
        enrich_traceroute: false  # Traceroute will show basic hop info without ASN/org data
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    **IP Enrichment Dependency**
    
    Without IP enrichment enabled:
    - Traceroute hops will only show IP addresses and RTT values
    - No ASN, organization names, or country information will be displayed
    - AS path visualization will be limited or unavailable
    - IXP detection will not function
    
    For the full structured traceroute experience with rich metadata, `ip_enrichment.enrich_traceroute: true` is required.
</Callout>
