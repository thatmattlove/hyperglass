# Quick Start Configuration Examples

Here are the most common configuration patterns to get you started with hyperglass quickly. For complete documentation, see the [Complete Configuration Reference](/configuration/config/complete-config).

## Minimal Configuration

The absolute minimum configuration needed:

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
site_title: "My Network Looking Glass"
org_name: "My Company"
primary_asn: 65000
```

## Basic Corporate Setup

A typical corporate setup with branding and terms of service:

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
# Basic info
site_title: "ACME Networks Looking Glass"
org_name: "ACME Networks Inc."
primary_asn: 65000
site_description: "Network diagnostic tools for ACME Networks"

# Performance
request_timeout: 120
cache:
  timeout: 300  # 5 minutes

# Web interface
web:
  # Custom branding
  logo:
    light: "/etc/hyperglass/images/company-logo-light.svg"
    dark: "/etc/hyperglass/images/company-logo-dark.svg"
    
  # Welcome message with terms
  greeting:
    enable: true
    title: "Terms of Service"
    file: "/etc/hyperglass/terms.md"
    required: true
    button: "I Agree"
    
  # Interface customization
  text:
    title: "Network Operations Center"
    subtitle: "AS65000 Looking Glass"
    
  # Footer links
  links:
    - title: "Company Website"
      url: "https://acmenetworks.com"
      show_icon: false
      side: "left"
    - title: "Network Status"
      url: "https://status.acmenetworks.com"
      side: "right"
```

## Privacy-Focused Setup

Emphasizing user privacy and security:

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
site_title: "Privacy-First Looking Glass"
org_name: "SecureNet"
primary_asn: 65001

web:
  # Use privacy-focused DNS
  dns_provider:
    name: "cloudflare"  # More privacy-focused than Google
    
  # Informative text about privacy
  text:
    ip_button: "Detect My IP (Private)"
    fqdn_message: "Securely resolved {fqdn} to"
    
  # Privacy-focused greeting
  greeting:
    enable: true
    title: "Your Privacy Matters"
    content: |
      ## Privacy Notice
      
      - DNS queries use encrypted DNS-over-HTTPS
      - Your IP detection happens in your browser
      - We don't log sensitive query details
      - All connections use HTTPS encryption
    required: false
    button: "I Understand"

# Minimal logging
logging:
  format: "text"
  # No HTTP webhooks for privacy
```

## High-Performance Setup

Optimized for performance with extended caching:

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
site_title: "High-Performance Looking Glass"
org_name: "FastNet ISP"
primary_asn: 65002

# Performance optimizations
request_timeout: 60      # Faster timeouts
cache:
  timeout: 600          # Cache for 10 minutes
  show_text: true       # Show cache status

web:
  # Optimized text
  text:
    cache_prefix: "Cached result expires in "
    complete_time: "‚ö° Completed in {seconds}"
    
  # Performance theme
  theme:
    colors:
      primary: "#059669"    # Fast green
      secondary: "#0ea5e9"  # Speed blue
    default_color_mode: "dark"  # Easier on eyes

# Structured output for faster parsing
structured:
  rpki:
    mode: "external"
    backend: "cloudflare"  # Fast RPKI validation
```

## ISP/Service Provider Setup

Configuration for internet service providers:

```yaml filename="config.yaml"
